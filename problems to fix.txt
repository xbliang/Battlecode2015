Feel free to add MOAR!!!

miner factory (1)
drones (?) prioritize (miners, miner factories, then beavers), move away from soldiers
then branch out to strategy



Idea:
-implementing building drones at beginning and killing miners
-



Things to fix:
1.) Beavers get stuck mining around HQ and get in the way of HQ spawning more beavers
2.) Swarming doesn't really work because they all get stuck -- Lucy is working on pathing
3.) Mining creates a dead region where lots of robots (like miners) get stuck and just move around without doing anything -- maybe we can make the robots prefer to stay away from each other (in a way that they don't get stuck)... maybe we can also have robots tell other robots when they find somewhere new with lots of ore so the tendency is to push the frontier while mining... maybe until they get too close to the enemy
4.) How do we kill towers? (a lot of games probably end on # of towers) TANKS??? Justine will try to implement tanks
5.) Maybe we want soldiers on the outside, miners in the middle, and beavers on the inside (near headquarters)
6.) getting bashers to hit multiple targets
7.) implement different strategies depending on map terrain
what to do when you have a good idea what the terrain tiles are
big rectangles, what to do when you know what the rectangles are
8.) defending TOWERS!!! -if towers low on HP then more units can be sent to defend it
9.) sending scouts at beginning
10.) more attack micro
11.) if you encounter a tower on your way to HQ and tower threat is not that high, everyone attack same tower
12.) congregate closer to enemy HQ so forces don't get spread thin?
13.) only create soldiers if hq are close together so we can attack earlier?
